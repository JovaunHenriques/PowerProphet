The aim of this project is to create a simple website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
## Description 
This website is made with the purpose of monitoring and estimating the passive and active usage of any given appliance's or equipment's voltage and or wattage.
##Feature to be added for scalability

1. Appliance Database:
- A comprehensive database of common household appliances and their power specifications (wattage and voltage). Include information on both standby and operational power consumption.

2. User-Friendly Interface:
- An intuitive and easy-to-use interface for users to search for appliances or input their own data.
Incorporate a search bar with auto-suggestions to help users find appliances quickly.

3. Custom Appliance Input:
- Allow users to input data for appliances not found in the database. Include fields for name, wattage, and voltage.
Implement a verification system for user-submitted data to maintain accuracy.

4. Calculation Engine:
- A robust calculation engine that accurately estimates power consumption based on user input and the appliance database.
Provide the option to calculate daily, weekly, or monthly energy usage.
5. Responsive Design:
- Ensure your website is mobile-friendly and works well on various devices and screen sizes.

  6. Energy Cost Estimation:
- Integrate a feature that calculates the energy cost based on the user's location and the current electricity rates. Consider allowing users to input their specific electricity rates for accuracy.
  
  7. Energy Efficiency Recommendations:
- Offer tips and suggestions on how users can reduce their energy consumption and save on electricity bills.
Provide information on energy-efficient appliances and their benefits.

8. User Accounts and Profiles:
- Implement user registration and profiles to save their appliance data and usage history.
Enable users to track their energy consumption trends over time.

9. Scalable Infrastructure:
Build your website on a scalable cloud infrastructure to handle increasing user traffic and data storage needs as the platform grows.

10. API Integration:
- Consider creating an API that allows other applications and websites to access your wattage/voltage estimation service, increasing your platform's reach.

11. Multilingual Support:
- Make your website accessible to users from different regions by providing support for multiple languages.

12. Feedback and Reporting:
- Include a feature that allows users to report inaccurate data or suggest improvements.
- Set up an email system for users to receive updates, energy-saving tips, and maintenance reminders.

13. Data Analytics and Insights:
- In the future, implement data analytics tools that provide insights into energy usage trends and patterns for users.

14. Smart Home Integration (Future):
- Consider integrating with smart home devices and systems to provide real-time energy monitoring and control.

15. Community and Social Features (Future):
- Add a community forum or discussion board where users can share energy-saving tips and experiences.
- Integrate social media sharing options to help users spread the word about your service.

16. Mobile App (Future):
- Develop a mobile app version of your website for on-the-go access.

Remember to continuously update and improve your website based on user feedback and emerging technologies to ensure its long-term scalability and relevance in the field of energy efficiency.
